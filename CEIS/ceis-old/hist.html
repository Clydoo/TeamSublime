  <h1> CEIS at a Glance</h1>
<h5 id="indenttext">Since Trinity University of Asia’s inception in 1963, it continues to expand its horizon by offering various courses to keep up with the rapid developments in the academe. In its tradition of excellence, service and quality Christian education, it is one of the pioneer schools which offered Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 1988.</h5>
<br>
<h5 id="indenttext">Cognizant of the fact that the field of Computer Science is highly related to Mathematics, it was first offered in the Department of Mathematics and Physics under the leadership of Dr. Socorro M. Rodriguez. For almost a decade after its launch, it had become the flagship course in the College of Arts & Sciences reaching its peak in the year 1998 with a total population of almost 1200.</h5>
<br>
<h5 id="indenttext">When the College of Computing and Information Sciences (CCIS) was formally inaugurated in 2009, with Professor Rosauro E. Manuel as its first Dean, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology discipline was offered along with its existing BSCS course. From the Lyman Ogilby Building, the College was transferred to a four-storey building, the Student Services Center, which now houses its five (5) computer laboratory rooms and engineering facilities.</h5><br>
<h5 id="indenttext">Realizing the unabated demand for specialized Information Technology professionals worldwide, the college expanded its BSIT program by having three (3) areas of specializations such as Software Engineering, Mobile and Web Applications, and Multimedia Arts and Animation.</h5>
<br>
<h5 id="indenttext"> The unwavering efforts of Dean Manuel paved the way for the CHED’s approval of another discipline within the same realm of study which is Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. Hence, the inception of Department of Computer Engineering in the year 2014.</h6><br>
<h5 id="indenttext">From 2015-2016, Prof. Henry L. De Guzman became the OIC-Dean of the College. Subsequently, Prof. Randy D. Lagdaan and Prof. Laurie Lee R. Bathan became the OIC-Deans of the College for first semester and second semester of school year 2016-2017 respectively.</h5>
<br>
<h5 id="indenttext">In anticipation of new engineering program offerings and inevitable updates in existing programs, the college name was changed to College of Engineering and Information Sciences (CEIS) in 2017. From 2017 to the present, the College is under the stewardship of Dr. Ferdinand R. Bunag. Among the recent developments in the College are state-of-the-art engineering equipment and facilities, a Multimedia Arts Laboratory housing 38 units of the latest Mac computers, integration of Microsoft and CISCO certifications in the BSIT curriculum, and creation of new IT specialization, the Data Science and Analytics.</h5>
<br>
<h5 id="indenttext">Throughout its ten (10) years of existence, the College has become the alma mater of successful IT professionals who are working in top IT companies, both here and abroad, like Microsoft Corporation, IBM Philippines, Accenture, Oracle Suite, among others. They have become successful in their chosen careers in Information Technology, excelling in diverse fields such as application programming, systems administration, web development, graphics design, networking, and multimedia content development.</h5>
<br>
<h5 id="indenttext">To live up to its vision-mission, the College is faithfully continuing its noble thrust of maintaining outstanding academic standards in its programs and empowering students for professional careers that will entail diverse skills to meet complex and unanticipated challenges in the fields of engineering and information sciences.</h5>
